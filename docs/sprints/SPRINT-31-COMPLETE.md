## Database Schema

### Tables Added (3)

#### sdwan_path_health

    health_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    path_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
    latency_ms REAL NOT NULL,
    packet_loss_pct REAL NOT NULL,
    jitter_ms REAL NOT NULL,
    health_score REAL NOT NULL,
    status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('up', 'degraded', 'down')) NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX idx_path_health_path_time ON sdwan_path_health(path_id, timestamp);
```

#### sdwan_failover_policies
Stores failover policy configurations.
```sql
CREATE TABLE sdwan_failover_policies (
    policy_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    primary_path_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    backup_path_ids TEXT NOT NULL,
    failover_threshold REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 50.0,
    failback_threshold REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 80.0,
    failback_delay_secs INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 60,
    enabled INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
);
```

#### sdwan_failover_events
Audit trail for all failover events.
```sql
CREATE TABLE sdwan_failover_events (
    event_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    policy_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    event_type TEXT CHECK(event_type IN (...)) NOT NULL,
    from_path_id TEXT,
    to_path_id TEXT,
    reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (policy_id) REFERENCES sdwan_failover_policies(policy_id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_failover_events_policy_time ON sdwan_failover_events(policy_id, timestamp);
```

## Integration Verification

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- All Sprint 30 tests continue to pass
- All Sprint 29 tests continue to pass
- All Sprint 28 tests continue to pass
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

### ✅ Database Migrations
- Migrations are additive only
- No modifications to existing tables
- Proper indexes created
- Foreign key constraints enforced

### ✅ Performance
- No degradation of existing functionality
- New features meet performance targets
- Memory usage within acceptable limits
- Database queries are efficient

---

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Expected Limitations

1. **Simulated Probes**
   - Network probes are currently simulated for testing
   - Production deployment requires actual ICMP/UDP implementation
   - Framework is ready for real probe integration

2. **Single-Node Failover**
   - Failover decisions are made independently per node
   - Multi-node coordination not yet implemented
   - Suitable for single-node or simple deployments

3. **Metrics Retention**
   - No automatic cleanup of old metrics data
   - Database will grow over time
   - Manual cleanup required via SQL or future feature

4. **Scalability Testing**
   - Tested with ~100 paths
   - Larger deployments may need optimization
   - Performance characteristics known for tested scale

### Non-Issues

These were considered but are NOT issues:
- ✅ Thread safety: All components properly synchronized
- ✅ Error handling: Comprehensive error propagation
- ✅ Memory leaks: No leaks detected in testing
- ✅ Database locking: Proper transaction handling
- ✅ Race conditions: Eliminated via proper locking
